					<h1>Karnataka</h1>
					<img src="./images/karnataka.jpg" alt="karnatalka" style="width:340px;height:210px;">
					<p>
						Karnataka is a state in southwest India with Arabian Sea coastlines. The capital, Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), is a high-tech hub known for its shopping and nightlife. To the southwest, Mysore is home to lavish temples including Mysore Palace, former seat of the region’s maharajas. Hampi, once the medieval Vijayanagara empire’s capital, contains ruins of Hindu temples, elephant stables and a stone chariot.
						<p><strong>Capital </strong> Bangalore</p>
						<p><strong>Area </strong> 191,791 km²</p>
						<p><strong>Population </strong> 64.06 million (2014)</p>
						<p><strong>Government body </strong> Government of Karnataka</p>

					<h3>Culture</h3>
					<img src="./images/culture.jpg" alt="karnatalka" style="width:340px;height:210px;">
					<p>
						Karnataka has hosted and continues to host a wide melting pot culture community. Along with the native Kannadigas, Kodavas, Tuluvas, Konkanis and several tribal sects have, across the centuries, lent colour and content to the vibrant culture the state calls its own. Karnataka is also home to the largest Tibetan settlement in South India. The recent past has seen a more inclusive populace with a large expatriate community making a beeline for the capital city of Bangalore. In addition to Kannada, knowing Tulu, Hindi, English, Telugu or Tamil will safely get you by. Jainism, Hinduism and Islam are the predominantly practised religions. But in recent times, Sikhism, Christianity and Buddhism have also found their place and people. 
						In dance, drama, theatre, crafts, art, poetry, architecture and scholarly pursuits, Karnataka brings with it a legacy of learning that predates the earliest dynasties. Perhaps the reason why the state, even to this date, is also home to some of the country's best academic institutions.

					<h3>Cuisine</h3>
					<img src="./images/cuisine.jpg" alt="karnatalka" style="width:340px;height:210px;">
					<p>
						Karnataka is a gracious host and offers a spread that appeals to every palate. Traditional Kannadiga cuisine is typically South Indian with a little bit of sweetness for added measure. But that doesn't begin to sum it all. The feast of the land includes Udupi, Mangalorean, Kodava and yes, Kannadiga, which again is a journey in itself - it varies with the geographical features. Even cereals vary and consumed in every imaginable and unimaginable form. To the uninitiated, some of the preparations might come across as bewildering, but no less delicious. Add to this, a highly evolved sweet tooth, and you get the deliriously wonderful concoctions, which are like nothing else in the world. With Karnataka, the pudding is the proof itself, and you see where the state gets its signature gusto from.

					<h3>Art Form</h3>
					<img src="./images/art.jpg" alt="karnatalka" style="width:340px;height:210px;">

				<p>
					Karnataka as a patron of arts has nurtured it into the exemplar. Poets, musicians, dancers, thespians, story tellers, writers, artists have flourished in these parts and have contributed to the state's well-versed repertoire. India's most respected schools of music, Carnatic and Hindustani over the centuries, were perfected here, with the state bringing forth many greats - Gangubai Hangal, Puttaraj Gawai, Pt. Bhimsen Joshi and Purandara Dasa, among others. Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Kathak and Odissi have found their niche in the mainstream culture, and the state boasts some of the best schools in the country. Its characteristic penchant for vibrancy can be seen from the state's performing arts, which it has perfected into one of extravagance, drama and sheer delight.

					A slew of folk arts have their roots in ritualistic performances. While Yakshagana is undisputedly the poster-child of the art forms, its lesser known counterparts are as enthralling as they are many. We've listed them out for you here.

				<div id="fest">
					<h3>Festivals</h3>
					<img src="./images/festival.jpg" alt="karnatalka" style="width:340px;height:210px;">
					<p>
						Karnataka's millennia-long tryst with royalty has left an indelible mark on its celebrations. There's nothing understated about the way Karnataka celebrates. Revelry that's complete in every way, with dance, music, great food and a riot of colours is a tradition here. From remembering the glorious past with art, music and poetry like the Hampi Festival does to frenzied bovine energy amidst muddy fields of the Kambala buffalo races - the spectrum is quite wide.
						The festival of Dasara has the entire city of Mysore in raptures, while the scion of the royal family, once again dons his purple robes to pay a centuries-old extravagant homage to the guardian goddess. The many harvest festivals celebrated in various parts of the state are commemorated in ways that they deem befitting - from making an offering of groundnuts to the resident deity to firing a single shot to summon a god to making sugar idols - there's never a want for ceremony in these parts. And then you have the ceremony to end all ceremonies - the once-in-twelve-years larger than life religious ceremony of the Maha Mastakabhisheka has a 52-foot statue of Bahubali is bathed in milk, sandalwood, vermillion, curd and what not. The festivals here are definitely the stuff of spectacular.
